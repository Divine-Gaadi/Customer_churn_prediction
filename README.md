# Predicting Customer Retention Behaviour In A Telecommunications Company Using Machine Learning Methods

This project analyzes data from a telecommunication company with the aim of predicting customer churn using machine learning algorithms and proposing relevant retention strategies. Six machine learning classification algorithms were implemented: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, Light Gradient Boosting Machine Classifier and Artificial Neural Network. The result shows that Random Forest outperforms other models.

The Data for this study was obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). The dataset provides information about the customers in a telecommunications company. Each row represents a customer, and the columns contain customer attributes, resulting in 7043 rows and 21 columns.
